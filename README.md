# Infotrack

I have passed the initial values in the text boxes so that it can save the user from typing values in

The first text box contains part of the URL that will be used in the browser's address bar to carry out the search using google search engine

Second text box will take the key words that will be used for the search : (land registry search) in this case

Last text box will contain the target URL whose position we want to find in the list of search results

Clicking the Submit button will give you the position(number) www.infotrack.co.uk appears in the results
